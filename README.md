**Frontend for the AI-Powered RateMyProfessors Platform**  
This project implements a clean, responsive chat interface for interacting with the RateMyProfessors AI assistant.

## What I Built
I created a **user-friendly chat interface** that allows students and professors to interact with the AI assistant. The interface is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, with real-time responses displayed in a conversation-style layout.

### Features
- **Real-time chat**: Users can send questions and receive instant AI responses.  
- **Clean design**: Centralized layout with readable fonts and light colors.  
- **Responsive**: Works well on desktop and mobile screens.  
- **User-friendly**: Easy input and clear separation of user and AI messages.

## How It Works
1. **User Input** â†’ Users type a message in the chat box.  
2. **Message Display** â†’ The message appears in the chat window.  
3. **AI Response** â†’ The frontend sends the message to a backend (or mock AI for testing).  
4. **Response Display** â†’ The AIâ€™s reply is displayed in the chat interface.

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Layout:** Flexbox for message alignment, responsive chat container  
- **Styling:** Light colors, readable fonts (e.g., Merriweather), subtle shadows  
- **Functionality:** Vanilla JS handles sending/receiving messages and updating the DOM

## Next Steps / Improvements
- Add **typing indicators** for AI responses.  
- Implement **scroll-to-bottom** for long conversations.  
- Enhance UI with **animated message bubbles**.
